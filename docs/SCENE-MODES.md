# Scene modes and camera review

The normal experience opens on **The watch** (tower, angle 1), with the tour: each shot holds 6 to 9 seconds, about 50 seconds a loop, and dissolves into the next over 1 second, staggered by depth: the sky changes first, then the mountains, the ground and the tower or tree, with no dip to black. The seven tour shots comprise three tower views and four tree views. Masonry study is excluded from the tour; its explicit comparison URL remains available. These controls are defined by source, not by the numeric orbit guidance in older notes.

## Directed views

Append a query to the local preview, for example:

    http://127.0.0.1:4173/?view=tower&angle=1&tour=0

| URL selection | Shot |
| --- | --- |
| view=tower&angle=1 | The watch |
| view=tower&angle=2 | Threshold (the ladder arriving at the gallery) |
| view=tower&angle=3 | Masonry study (comparison only; excluded from tour; the name is kept for a lattice structure study) |
| view=tower&angle=4 | Gallery detail (gallery floor to eave) |
| view=tree&angle=1 | Portrait |
| view=tree&angle=2 | Lantern study |
| view=tree&angle=3 | Close-up |
| view=tree&angle=4 | Root and lantern |

Explicit view/angle selects the opening composition; add tour=0 to hold it. Without a tour parameter each shot keeps its own hold (`hold` in directed-shots.js): The watch and Portrait 9 seconds, Threshold and Gallery detail 7, the other tree shots 6. tour=3, 5 and 20 are fixed review cadences for every shot; the dissolve takes 1 second, or 0.9 at tour=3. The tour has no shot label or control strip. Panels, developer camera control, reduced motion, and a visitor pause suspend automatic cycling; missing subjects are skipped.

## Visitor pause

The owner retired the footer's Pause scene control on 2026-09-24; About holds the footer's right corner, and the scene always plays (reduced motion, hidden tabs and open dialogs still pause it). `BabelSite.scene.setVisitorPaused()` remains for scripted review. setVisitorPaused()`; `isVisitorPaused()` reads the state back. A pause holds the tour on its current shot, ends a dissolve in progress on its incoming shot, stops drift and clouds, and then stops rendering. A resize, context restore, or model, map, shader or font change draws one still frame; scroll does not. Resuming continues the same shot from that clear frame without a time jump; an interrupted dissolve is not replayed. visitorPausedPreference`, which applies once the scene is revealed, so the first revealed frame stays on screen. Without a quality or sceneDebug override, reduced-motion and reduced-data visitors, like other static poster paths, never load the scene and show no pause control.

The camera fits authored focal volumes into the responsive composition area. Portrait overrides are intentional. Edit [directed-shots.js](../src/scene/directed-shots.js) for shot intent and holds, [cinematic.js](../src/scene/cinematic.js) for fitting and drift, [camera-tour.js](../src/scene/camera-tour.js) for timing, and [postprocess.js](../src/scene/postprocess.js) for the depth-staggered dissolve, whose layer codes are set in [depth-layers.js](../src/scene/depth-layers.js).

## Retained comparisons

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| view=orbit | Previous orbital camera |
| cinematography=baseline | Prior cinematic treatment |
| architecture=assembled | Earlier assembled architecture |
| architecture=classic | Procedural/classic architecture |
| setting=previous | Previous setting and orbit |
| setting=plinth | Raised platform comparison |
| ground=earth | Previous default film ground: Poly Haven earth and grass maps and the brown earth tone, in the otherwise unchanged authored scene (no legacy world) |
| ground=desert / ground=procedural | Earlier ground treatments |
| scale=baseline | Earlier prop proportions |
| stone=procedural / brick=boxes | Legacy material/brick comparisons where applicable |

[scene-modes.js](../src/scene/scene-modes.js) centralizes URL mode policy. The default film ground is the dark cracked slate (the seamless slate v2 maps with wetness, puddles and contact shading) with the owner's scattered rocks; `ground=earth` is the only comparison parameter that does not also build the legacy world, because it swaps just the film terrain maps. `rocks=off` hides the scattered rocks for review and never downloads their chunk or models. These combinations are compatibility and review controls, not separate current designs. Some comparisons apply only to their matching architecture mode. Defaults and fallback behavior must remain consistent when refactoring.

## Accessibility and diagnostics

Without overrides, reduced motion/data, unavailable WebGL, and software rendering retain the static poster path. An explicit quality=low, quality=balanced, quality=high, or sceneDebug=1 requests the diagnostic live path when WebGL is available; it is not a way to bypass release gates. A live reduced-motion review holds camera motion. With sceneDebug=1, the Backquote key activates the desktop developer camera and its debug HUD; the key does nothing for ordinary visits and is ignored while a panel is open. Its code loads as a separate chunk only for sceneDebug=1 sessions. The scene requests that chunk as soon as it reads the flag, so the download overlaps initialization, and the key responds once the chunk has arrived, normally by the time initialization finishes. The developer camera renders through a visitor pause, restores the held frame when it exits, and does not define visitor framing.

See [OPERATIONS.md](../OPERATIONS.md) for the exact delivery and release policy. Historical QA snapshots live in [history](history/README.md); their ports, scores, camera numbers, and publication claims refer to their original run.
